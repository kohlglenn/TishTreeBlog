  title: My urban forest journey.
---
I am a passionate tree nerd and a university student that is studying the urban forest. As part of this journey, I have decided to make a digital collection of all of the trees in my urban forest and my personal experiences with them. I have learned so much about trees already, but I realized how easily this information can be lost. I would like this blog to be my legacy of insights, ideas, experiences, passions, and knowledge. It will be something I can cherish and will bring with me throughout my entire career constantly building and reflecting as I learn and change in life.

I will be regularly exploring different trees and the things that I have learned about them. I have learned about how restorative and necessary nature is and I have decided to combine my technical learning with what it means to connect on a more fulfilling level. As I learn details about trees, I will search them out in my urban forest and personally experience them as well. 

Feel free to come along for the journey.
