  title: My urban forest journey.
---
I am a passionate tree nerd and a university student studying the urban forest. As part of this journey, I have tasked myself with making a deeper connection with nature, reflecting on the trees in my urban forest from beneath them. I will be regularly exploring, attempting to identify trees while enjoying their restorative powers. 

Feel free to come along for the journey.
