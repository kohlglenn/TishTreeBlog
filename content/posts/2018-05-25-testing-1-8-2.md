The features that I used to ID this tree were the peeling coppery bark, the opposite buds, and the simple tri-folate leaf. Since it is April there are no samaras present, otherwise that would have been another indicator that this was a type of maple tree. I found this tree visually interesting, but its small size did not provide much canopy to sit under. It is otherwise just a nice feature tree.
